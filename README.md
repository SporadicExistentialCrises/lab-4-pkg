Lab 4: Software Packaging & Testing Fundamentals  

The goal of this lab is to:  
1. Scaffold a minimal Python package (geometry-demo) with a clean public API;
2. Write a small test-suite with pytest and run it locally;
3. Install a package in editable mode and confirmed importability from another script.

Purpose:  
This simple geometry package features two custom classes: Square and Circle. The function area_stats() produces statistics about the areas of a list of squares and circles. 

Install:  
Use pip install to install the geometry package.

Usage:
Use area_stats() to create a list of number of shapes, total area, average area, min area, and max area.
